Magic Eight Ball
Magic 8-ball  (See 3.2.3 Programming challenge on CSAwesome if you need some ideas)
Have you ever seen a Magic 8-ball?  You ask it a yes-no question and then shake it to get a random response like “Signs point to yes!”, or “Very doubtful”, etc.  (Check out the simulator linked in CSAwesome if you wish.)

Come up with 8 responses to yes-no questions.  Write a program on Replit that chooses a random number from 1 to 8 and then uses if statements to test the number and print out the associated random response from 1 – 8.    

Requirements-
-	Header including your name, date, project title and project description must be included.
-	Programming comments should be included for each logical block of code
-	Program should ask the user to enter a yes-no question.
-	After the user enters a question, the program should randomly choose one of 8 responses chosen by using a random number.
-	Output should be easy to read, with no typographical errors.
